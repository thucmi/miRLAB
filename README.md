# miRLAB
miRLAB package from Bioconductor.

Previously, Bioconductor did not receive submission directly from a git repository. This is the project created from Rstudio and submitted to Bioconductor.

On 21/01/2017, I created the repository for miRLAB to keep track of the development of the project via Github. Anything updated here will need to be uploaded/updated to the Bioconductor branch (see a note from miRLAB for how to do)
